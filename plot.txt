#Courses: put cousers in a set with their correspoinding subjects
#Points: make a set of how things will be equated
#Validation make sure everyone gives the right info
#put the person's info in a set, or array and store it
#make history of failed and accepted people in two different sets
#name, gender, course of choice
#make use of the submit button
#put email feature..

Steps:
1.make available the courses and what it takes to get them
2.make sense of the marks
3.we gonna need the data from the user and put validations in place
4.equate the data with respective expected logic...as per step 2
5.store the given data at the end
6.Give feedback according to stored data of the person

Pointers and helpers:
=====================
1.Avail courses by both drop down and search and sort of iterating through the list.
2.Suggest things as the user types in a course and they can choose from the suggestion.
3.Should automatically complete other tabs when user puts there score
 in correspondence to their mark.eg A for Math should be 6 for points or 1 for gp should automatically be 1 point.
4.Should easily be able to add as many courses as I want..just create the flow of the program
and everythimg else works on its own.

Add on in the course:
====================
Automatically suggest something one can apply for if they can't qualify for a certain course.
Automatically arrange subjects in a responsible format
